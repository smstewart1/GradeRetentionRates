# GradeRetentionRates
This project was to look at grade rentention for students in the CHM151/152/251/252 sequence

This project used python scripting to sort through student data to determine grade rentetion - e.g., how many A students from a previous course got an A/B/C/D/F/W in the next course - to determine how well the previous course was preparing students for the next course in the sequence.  The script automatically generated reports by course, ethnicity, and gender.  Because the raw data contains presonal information, it has been omitted from this repository.
